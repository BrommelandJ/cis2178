<h1>CIS 2178 - Capstone Project</h1>

<p>
    For their CIS 2178 Capstone Project, students developed personal
    portfolios, highlighting their technical ability. For these portfolios, they
    were allowed to use any current web development tools and frameworks
    available to them, with the objective of developing something visually
    impressive that would aid them in the pursuit of employment.
