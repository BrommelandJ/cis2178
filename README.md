# CIS 2178 - Summer 2018
## Capstone Project
Your capstone project will consist of two parts:
1. Creating a portfolio site and hosting it on GitHub pages
2. Submitting pull requests to this site

## 1. Creating a Portfolio Site
Having a personal website is important for getting a position in the computer programming field. 
It shows you can complete a project - start to finish - on your own. It shows initiative and a 
willingness to pickup new things. It also shows that you care about your career and are willing to
go the extra mile to present yourself in the best light possible.

Grading Rubric for your Portfolio Site:
* Hosted on the internet (use GitHub pages for free!) and available at an easy to type domain name (http://username.github.io or a personal domain name).
* Must be well designed and look professional. Using "themes" from others is ok! No broken links, images, unstyled content, etc...
* Must (at least) have content one would expect to find on a resume (about, work history, education, interests, etc...)
* Must have a blog section with at least one post on a technical topic (could be about hosting your site, technologies used, etc...)
* Must present the site to the rest of the class during the last week


## 2. Submitting a Pull Request
This section will consist of two main tasks. First, you will need to add yourself to the students section 
of this website. Follow the existing markup/styling and add your name, details, picture, and link to your portfolio site.
For the second part, you will have a bug assigned to you that you will have to fix.

To accomplish these tasks, you'll need to fork this repo, modify and test the code, and then submit a pull 
request to me for credit.
